VIDEO: "6 REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD WORK IN I.T."

Q: Do you agree with any of those reasons? If so, which one and why?

A: Yeah I totally agree with the first one which says that you should do it if you really
love technology. I agree with that statement because that's exactly why I chose to work
in IT. I thought "well, if I'm gonna do something for the rest of my life I might as well
choose something I won't ever get bored by, because I'll be doing it day in and day out.
And turns out I was right. I've been working in IT for 9 years now, and I love it. I'm
super happy with where I am right now and with where this path may take me in the near future,
which I hope it's somewhere around North America. Btw, the dude's glasses in the video are
totally crooked.
