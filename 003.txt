- Globalisation has really thrown down the geographical barriers and it's able to 
bring together people from around the world so we need to be mindful of the cultural
differences to make communicating and working together as efficient as possible.
So the article talks about a few tips to make that possible.

- The one I enjoyed the most was the first tip, which said "have an open mind". Because
our mind is like a parachute, it has to be open in order to function correctly. And
if you don't embrace new ideas you're gonna come off as a condescending person most
of the times as if you were too good to learn more about someone else's culture.
